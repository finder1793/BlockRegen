## Development

If you wish to contribute or develop a fork of the plugin for yourself, you're more than welcome to.
Be sure to open a PR if you implement anything that could be meaningful for others using the plugin!

In order to install local dependencies distributed with the source, run `mvn initialize`. \
This is done because there's no public repository to take the latest dependencies from.
